🚀 IBM Data Science Capstone Project
📌 Overview

This repository contains my final capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
The project focuses on analyzing SpaceX Falcon 9 launch records to determine factors influencing the success of launches, create interactive dashboards, and build predictive models.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data collection from APIs and web scraping.

Conduct data wrangling and preprocessing.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL.

Build interactive visualizations with Folium maps and Plotly Dash dashboards.

Develop and evaluate predictive machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN).

Deliver insights and conclusions on factors affecting launch success probability.

🛠️ Methodology

Data Collection & Wrangling

Collected SpaceX data using REST APIs and web scraping with BeautifulSoup.

Cleaned and wrangled datasets into structured form.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

SQL queries for insights.

Visualized launch patterns using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

Created interactive Folium maps for launch sites and outcomes.

Interactive Dashboard

Built with Plotly Dash to explore launch success by site and payload.

Predictive Analysis

Trained ML models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN.

Performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

Evaluated using accuracy scores.

📊 Results & Key Insights

Launch site KSC LC-39A showed the highest success rate.

Heavier payloads had slightly lower success probability.

Folium maps displayed clear geographic clustering of successful launches.

Best ML model: Support Vector Machine (SVM with RBF kernel) achieved the highest validation accuracy.

The interactive dashboard allows dynamic analysis by site and payload range.

📈 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium)

SQL (SQLite, SQL magic in Jupyter)

Dash (Plotly Dash for interactive dashboards)

BeautifulSoup & Requests (Web scraping)

Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab / Cloud IDE
