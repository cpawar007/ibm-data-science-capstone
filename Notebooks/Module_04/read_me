# Module 4: Predictive Analysis (Machine Learning Models)

## Overview
- Applied machine learning models to predict launch outcomes.  
- Tuned models and compared performance.  

## Objectives
- Train and evaluate ML models on launch data.  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.  
- Identify the best performing model.  

## Methodology
- Split dataset into train/test sets (80/20).  
- Standardized features with `StandardScaler`.  
- Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN.  
- Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Evaluated models on validation and test sets.  

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved good accuracy.  
- SVM with RBF kernel performed best overall.  
- Decision Trees and KNN provided alternative insights.  

## Deliverables
- ML notebooks with training and results.  
- Accuracy metrics and best hyperparameters.
